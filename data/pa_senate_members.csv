After witnessing the September 11th attacks from the window of his law office in Newark, New Jersey, Steve decided to seek a new career in teaching as a way to serve the community. After a couple years of night classes at Holy Family University, Steve received his state certification and was hired as a social studies teacher at Bensalem High School. At BHS he worked hard to give the next generation a strong foundation in history and civics to help them succeed and participate fully as citizens of our country. <br /><br />At about that same time, Steve became a leader in a grassroots movement to stop a big box shopping mall in Lower Makefield. That experience led him to run for township supervisor. He was elected in 2003. As a supervisor he worked with both Republicans and Democrats alike. He led efforts to make government more open and transparent, to solve traffic problems, and to preserve open space and the environment. In 2008, Steve ran and won the State House seat in the Yardley-Newtown area of Bucks County. In Harrisburg he was a reformer, writing the bill that would ultimately get adopted as new House rules on keeping politics and government service separate; refusing perks like per diems and a state car; and not collecting his pay during prolonged budget impasses in 2009 and 2015-16. Steve was also a leader on education, infrastructure investment, environmental protection, women's health issues and gun violence prevention.<br /><br />Back home in Bucks County, Steve led the effort to get PECO to improve the resiliency of its electric grid, vastly reducing the number of power outages in the area. He also worked to bring jobs into his district and successfully lobbied the New Jersey Legislature to grandfather current employees when it passed a new law requiring all public sector workers in the Garden State to live in New Jersey, thereby saving the jobs of thousands of Bucks residents who worked across the Delaware River. In 2017, Attorney General Josh Shapiro appointed Steve the first Chief Deputy Attorney General for Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania. In that role, Steve oversaw the prosecution of environmental crimes and led Pennsylvania's efforts to fight the Trump Administration over proposed rollbacks of important environmental protections.

Boscola has spent the majority of her professional career working to improve the lives of Lehigh Valley residents. Born in Bethlehem on April 6, 1962 to Richard and Anna Stofko - Senator Boscola has remained a proud steel worker's daughter and life-long resident of the Lehigh Valley, a fact which has made her intimately familiar with the issues that face her district and the people she represents. First elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1994, Senator Boscola served two terms in the state House and is serving her fifth term representing the 18th Senatorial District, consisting of Northampton and Lehigh Counties. Prior to her election to the General Assembly, Senator Boscola served as Deputy Court Administrator with the Northampton County Court. She received her Bachelors and Masters degrees from Villanova University cum laude.",State Senator,Richard J. and Anna,"Wilson College for Minor Judiciary, Certification for D.J., 1987;  Villanova University, B.A. Political Science, (cum laude), 1984;  M.A. Political Science, 1985","Throughout her legislative career, Senator Boscola has worked tirelessly to bring property tax reform to the forefront of the debate in the General Assembly.  Senator Boscola has been a leading proponent of the total elimination of the local school property tax and has been a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 76. Every Session, she has also introduced legislation to freeze property taxes on seniors so that they can remain in their homes. Redistricting reform has been an issue that Senator Boscola has continued to fight for through the years by introducing legislation to amend the Pennsylvania Constitution, and change the way the Commonwealth conducts the redistricting process by removing politics and creating a truly Independent Citizen's Commission. Senator Boscola has also focused on the need for state government to promote economic development initiatives to provide family sustaining jobs to the Lehigh Valley and across the Commonwealth. She has worked diligently to bring the Lehigh Valley region our fair share of state funds for worthwhile local projects. She has been a strong advocate for funding economic development programs with proven track records of job creation and retention such as the Ben Franklin Technology Centers, Small Business Development Center and the Manufacturer's Resource Center. Working with the private sector to drive growth, job expansion and retention has been a focus for Senator Boscola. Cutting out the red tape, ensuring the State's incentives are competitive with surrounding states is one way government can help promote growth. Most recently, Senator Boscola was the proud prime sponsor of the omnibus bill, Senate Bill 421 of 2019-20, which is known, today, as Act 77 of 2019. Act 77 was the largest voting modernization bill in decades that included the elimination of straight party voting, extending the deadline for absentee ballot submissions, and created a no excuse mail-in voting option for all Pennsylvania voters, in which, ""kitchen tables and living rooms will be converted in polling places. Researching a candidate can be done while you vote from the comfort of your own home."" Senator Boscola was instrumental in bringing a City Revitalization and Improvement Zone (CRIZ) designation to Bethlehem. Senator Boscola fought hard to ensure that Bethlehem had an opportunity to submit a CRIZ application and has worked to ensure that the incentive will be a tool that would drive new growth to the region. It was in Senator Boscola's recognition that staying competitive required creative incentives to help generate new growth in the region, which is what the CRIZ accomplished. As our region continued to recover from the loss of Bethlehem Steel, the CRIZ looked to leverage new state tax increments to complete difficult development projects in Bethlehem and beyond. The redevelopment of the vacant steel land has proven successful and has created diverse job opportunities that have enabled Bethlehem and the Lehigh Valley to flourish and remain one of the most competitive regions, of size, in the Northeast. Currently, Senator Boscola serves as the Chair of the Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee where she has tirelessly protected consumers from utility rate increases. From 2011 through 2020, Senator Boscola served as Chair of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, where she lead the fight to bring policies into state government that would create family sustaining jobs, protect the rights of victims of crime, reform and reduce the size of state government and promote school to work opportunities.  Along with Consumer Protection, Senator Boscola is also a member of the Judiciary, Banking & Insurance, Game and Fisheries, Rules & Executive Nominations and Community, Economic & Recreational Development Committees.  Senator Boscola is also involved in a number of legislative caucus' including serving as co-chair of the Economy, Business & Jobs Caucus and the Community College Caucus. She is also a member of the Local & School Property Tax Relief Caucus, Legislative Sportsmen Caucus, Fire & Emergency Services Caucus, Early Childhood Education Caucus, among others.

As State Representative of the 92nd legislative district in Northern York County, Keefer cut her legislative teeth during her first year in office, developing a non-taxing solution to balance a state budget that included $1.5 billion more in spending than in projected revenues. Keefer was a key member of a small group of legislators who comprehensively exposed the Commonwealth's shadow budget - a budget that operates outside of the state's General Fund and possesses billions of surplus dollars. She quickly became a point person on special fund account activity and remains a watchdog for the taxpayers, working to bring these funds back into the General Fund and back into the hands of those who can be held accountable at the ballot box.<br /><br /><br /><br />This fighting spirit, along with a fierce commitment to individual freedom, is why Dawn was recruited to establish and chair Pennsylvania's Freedom Caucus in the fall of 2022. Under Dawn's leadership members of the PA Freedom Caucus offered and championed policy solutions to limit government and empower individuals and businesses and served as the backstop against initiatives attempting to grow government or siphon freedoms. <br /><br /><br /><br />Keefer is a free-market, fiscal conservative with more than 27 years of professional and government experience. As a small business owner for over ten years, Dawn operated a consulting firm focused on public relations, grass-roots strategy, membership development and fundraising. Additionally, Dawn's husband, Tom, has owned and operated a custom motorcycle business for more than 20 years. On both a professional and personal level she understands the day-to-day challenges of small businesses as she and her husband have experienced just how economically hostile Pennsylvania is for owners of small businesses. <br /><br /><br /><br />Dawn's personal and professional experiences are the impetus of her commitment to policy that gets government out of the way and allows families and businesses to prosper in a Commonwealth that's ripe with opportunity. She believes every expansion of government, at any level, results in a loss of personal freedoms and aggressively works against legislative proposals that grow government. To that end, Dawn has led the charge in regulatory reform, budget spending limits and transparency. <br /><br /><br /><br />Dawn's dedication to Pennsylvania and the people she represents is demonstrated through her work and her consistent engagement with communities throughout York and Cumberland counties. Staying well connected to the people who chose her to represent their interests in Harrisburg is central to everything Dawn does.

This landmark law and will save lives and help many families throughout Pennsylvania.<br /><br />An advocate for the welfare of children and youth, Ward led efforts to enact legislation reforming Pennsylvania's child abuse laws and providing greater protections for children against abuse.
